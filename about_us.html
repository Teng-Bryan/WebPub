	KeElectronics was founded by Bong, Aarush, Bryan, and Zheng Bo on 10 August 2025 with a shared goal: to become one of Asiaâ€™s leading e-commerce platforms for consumer electronics.
Our brand name is a tribute to our lecturer, Mr. Kee, who equipped us with the essential software development skills that brought our vision to life. By combining his name with our product focus, KeElectronics was born.
We specialize in reselling authentic consumer electronics, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets from a wide range of trusted brands. Headquartered in Singapore, we are committed to delivering reliable, affordable, and high-quality devices backed by exceptional customer service that makes every purchase memorable.
To enhance convenience, we offer free worldwide shipping and a seamless delivery experience. Our platform is built with our customers in mind, ensuring stress-free access to the tech they need without the hassle of stock shortages often found elsewhere.
We continuously welcome feedback and strive to improve. With plans to expand our reach beyond Singapore into neighboring countries and across the globe, we aim to bring our trusted services to even more customers. To support this growth, we are developing a new online platform that will allow consumers worldwide to browse, order, and receive our products right at their doorstep.
At KeElectronics, our vision is not only to grow as a business but to create a smarter, more accessible shopping experience, empowering people everywhere through technology.
